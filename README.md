# Haddr-Lang

## Purpose
This is a language that I am making, entirely in haskell trying to follow conventions of functional programming as closely as I can. Even before making the language, I would advise nobody to use this language professionally, this is just a project for my own interest.

If you see some problems, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request!

## Syntax
The source will be comprised of a list of expressions. Each expression either has a value associated with it (which it returns) or has no value. Each expression can be replaced with a value, which is either an integer, boolean, pointer, or null. Anything in between two parentheses will be treated as one expression.
